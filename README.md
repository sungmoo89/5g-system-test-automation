# 5G System Test Automation Framework

## Overview
This project demonstrates system-level automation inspired by real-world 5G field validation and integration testing.

## Key Features
- Python-based test framework using pytest
- Simulated 5G attach procedure
- Log parsing automation
- Modular test architecture
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions

## Why I Built This
As a 5G Field Test Engineer, I wanted to design a scalable automation framework that reduces manual validation efforts and improves repeatability in network testing.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pytest
- GitHub Actions
- System Test Architecture
